Q. What is a loop?
ans: Loop in programming a function or block of code that repeats code until a condition becomes false.

instead of writing like this :
System.out.println("Hello");
System.out.println("Hello");
System.out.println("Hello");

we write like this :
for(int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
}
